Cliffhouse Origin Overhaul
The Cliffhouse Origin Overhaul is a comprehensive overhaul project that aims to replace the Origins and Classes added by Origins (Forge) and Origins: Classes (Forge) with a new array of Sci-Fantasy options inspired by games like FTL, Endless Space, and Destiny.

 

Currently planned replacement features include:
- Origins replaced by Bloodlines; new Sci-Fi bloodlines replacing most of the default options from Origins.
- Classes replaced by Jobs; new Sci-Fi and Fantasy Jobs replacing most of the default options from Origins: Classes.


Currently planned new features include:
- Guilds: For a fee, join the Guild of your choice and to gain new buffs and abilities.
- Cults: Offer up a sacrifice to the gods of darkness to join a Cult and gain access to new eldritch powers.

To install, unpack the zip and move the folder inside the "Datapacks" folder for the world you want it installed on.

Requires Origins (Forge) and Origins Classes (Forge) installed prior to use.
